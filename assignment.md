## Homework Assignment: Dart Quiz Game

**Objective:**
Create a simple quiz game using Dart that quizzes the user on general knowledge questions. The game should include multiple-choice questions, keep track of the user's score, and provide feedback at the end.

**Requirements:**

1. **Question Bank:**
   - Create an array or list to store at least 10 multiple-choice questions. Each question should have a statement and a set of possible answers, with one correct answer.

2. **Game Logic:**
   - Write Dart functions to:
     - Display a welcome message and instructions to the user.
     - Randomly select questions from the question bank for each round.
     - Display the question and multiple-choice options.
     - Allow the user to input their answer.
     - Validate the user's answer and update their score.
     - Keep track of the total score across all questions.

3. **User Interaction:**
   - Use the `stdin.readLineSync()` function to get user input.
   - Provide feedback after each question, indicating whether the user's answer was correct or not.

4. **End of Game:**
   - Display the final score at the end of the quiz.
   - Add a creative message based on their performance (e.g., "You're a Dart Quiz Master!" or "Keep practicing!").

**Tips:**

- Consider adding a timer for each question to make it more exciting.
- Include a mix of easy and challenging questions to keep it interesting.
- Allow users to see the correct answer if they get a question wrong.
- Encourage creativity in formatting the quiz output.

**Bonus Challenges:**
For students who want an extra challenge, encourage them to implement additional features such as:
- Adding a countdown timer for each question.
- Allowing users to choose a difficulty level (easy, medium, hard).
- Creating a leaderboard to track high scores.

**Submission:**
Students can submit their Dart files containing the quiz game code along with a brief reflection on their design choices and any challenges they faced during the implementation.

This assignment not only reinforces the programming concepts covered but also allows students to apply their knowledge in a fun and interactive way. Happy coding!
